Explain how a value would be found using a tree

1.	Start at the top (the root).
2.	Compare the value you're looking for with the current node's value.
3.	Decide if you should go left or right based on the comparison.
4.	Move to the chosen side and repeat steps 2-3.
5.	Keep going until you find the value or reach the end of the tree.

Walkthrough your algorithm searching for the value ‘10’

1.	Start at the top: Begin at the top of the tree, which is the root node with a value of 10.
2.	Compare with the Current Node: Compare the value '10' with the current node's value, which is also '10'.
3.	Decide Where to Go: Since the value '10' matches the current node's value, we've found it. There's no need to move left or right.
4.	Stop: The search is complete.

Walkthrough your algorithm searching for the value ‘13’
- Start at the top: Begin at the top of the tree, which is the root node '10'.
- Compare with the Current Node: Check if '13' is equal to '10'. It's not a match.
- Decide Where to Go: Since '13' is greater than '10', go to the right because bigger values are on the right side.
- Move to the Right: We move to the right subtree.
- Compare with the Current Node: Check if '13' is equal to '15'. It's not a match.
- Decide Where to Go: Since '13' is less than '15', go to the left because smaller values are on the left side.
- Move to the Left: We move to the left subtree.
-  Compare with the Current Node: Check if '13' is equal to '11'. It's not a match.
- Decide Where to Go: Since '13' is greater than '11', go to the right subtree.
- Stop: There's no right subtree for '11', and we haven't found '13', so '13' is not in the tree
